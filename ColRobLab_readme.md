here's a link to hello robot instructions on how to wirelessly access Stretch-3 robots desktop.: https://docs.hello-robot.com/0.3/getting_started/connecting_to_stretch/

I've summarized the steps below. NOTE: it might be helpful to have 2 monitors during setup, 1 for stretch, and 1 for (second PC). However, you'll only ever need one monitor, and one PC after setup.

1) Before establishing a "wireless" connection to the robot, we must first access the robot's desktop by using a wired HDMI connection, to connect the robot's internal pc to a monitor. Stretch's base has HDMI, and USB connections you can use for your keyboard/mouse and monitor.
2) Now that you have access to Stretch's desktop, make sure you're connected to the same network connection that you'll be using for your (second PC).
3) open up a web browser, copy and paste this link to the search bar:  https://localhost:47990, you may encounter a warning, but feel free to bypass this warning by clicking "advance" and/or "continue/proceed"
4) you will be asked to create your login info for Sunshine, make sure to save this info somewhere safe. You should log in to sunshine right after
5) Once on Sunshine's homepage, navigate to the PIN section, you should see a box prompt for your PIN, but don't enter anything yet.
6) Now, on a (second PC)(separate from the robot), download the Moonlight software compatible with your PC's OS from this site: https://moonlight-stream.org
7) again, make sure you're connected to the same network connection as Stretch. If you open the Moonlight app, it should automatically detect your stretch robot as a PC. Click on it and you'll be given a 4-digit PIN. Enter this PIN on the Sunshine PIN page that you had open while you were on Stretch's desktop to pair Moonlight with your Stretch. Moonlight will remember this in the future.
8) Moonlight will now show you a page with a button labeled "Desktop". This will start the stream of Stretch's desktop to your laptop or (second PC). Don't click on it yet. If you already did, exit out using Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q.
9) locate the small HDMI dongle that came with your Stretch, unplug all cables from Stretch, and plug in this wireless HDMI dongle.
10) now, go to your (second PC) and click "desktop" on the Moonlight app. You now have a wireless connection to Stretch! an image of the wireless HDMI dongle is pasted here:<img width="101" alt="Stretch Hdmi dongle" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/718d174e-9e51-438d-b6b3-614271161291">
