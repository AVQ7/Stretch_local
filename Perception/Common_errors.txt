Problem :trying to access multiple cameras/devices using the same pipeline.
Error msgs: RuntimeError: Couldn't resolve requests
solution 1: 
- make sure the camera resolution specified in code is within hardware constraints of camera ( 640 by 480 usually works well on strecth 3 cameras)
solution 2: 
-   check other processes using your camera by typing in the terminal: lsof | grep video
-   terminate these processesone by one with command: kill -9 "PID number"
-   or terminate them all using this command: lsof | grep video | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -r kill -9

Problem: trying to access a component( arm, gripper head,..etc) of the robot that is already running another process
solution: 
-   free the robot with command: stretch_free_robot_process.py
-   if that doesn't work home the robot first with command: stretch_robot_home.py
    and then use the stretch_free_robot_process.py command.
